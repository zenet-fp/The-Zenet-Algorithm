# The-Zenet-Algorithm
This algorithm was thought of my me and is something that tries to tack a problem I have pondered upon for a while, is it possible for a person to go from place A to place B without knowing the locations of A and B, without knowing the distance beforehand, while having no clue of the paths they will need to take? Perhaps there exists something out there which a mathematician has alrady created to deal with this, however the journey to exploration must never end.

By no means is this a perfect solution or credible one, just an attempt by a computer science enthusiast.
